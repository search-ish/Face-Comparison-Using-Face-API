# Face-Comparison-Using-Face-API
This repository is for using the free version of the faceplusplus.com API to compare photos posted online or files of photos. Face++ requires payment to use their service except if you use their api it allows free usage. It requires that you first sign up for a Face++ free api account at https://console.faceplusplus.com/register
Sorry that you need to get an account on face++ first (please select  the face comparison type)
